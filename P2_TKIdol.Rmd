# Introduction

The data for the bicycle rental analysis and prediction consists of hourly rental information each day for a two year period (2011 & 2012) totaling > 17k observations. The goal of the project is to predict number of rentals for each day based on a set of predictors.

The data is split into  70% training & 30% test sets.  The training set is used for an initial summary analysis to determine optimal predictors and suitable predictive models.  Categorical variables are converted from numbers to factors for the summary analysis and renamed for more relevant interpretation.  Those were:  

+  season ("winter", "spring", "summer", "fall)  

+  hour (divided into: "late night", "AM commute", "mid day", "PM commute", "night")  

+  weather ("clear", "mist", "light precip", "heavy pricip")  

+  workday ("no", "yes")  

+  dteday


Numerical predictors considered in the summary analysis are: temp, humidity and windspeed

Categorical summaries include a table for rental mean and rental total for each factor and boxplots for each factor.

Numeric summaries include a 5 number summary, pairwise correlation table and scatter plots + lm faceted by season, hour & weather for each numeric variable.

Based on analysis of these variables final training / test sets were developed on season, hour, weather, temp, and humidity.  These sets were used to conduct Regression Tree and Boosted Regression tree training and prediction models. More info about predictor considerations and final model criteria with test results are discussed in the "Modeling" section.

# Data

```{r, data}
# read in csv data
bikeData <- read.csv("hour.csv")

# remove casual & registered vars since they will not be used for modeling
bikeData <- bikeData  %>% select(everything(), -c("casual", "registered")) %>% mutate(weekday = as.factor(weekday))

# filter for individual weekday reporting
bikeData <- bikeData  %>% filter(weekday == params$day)

# split data 70% train & 30% test
set.seed(100)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(bikeData$cnt, p = .7, list = FALSE)

bikeTrain <- bikeData[trainIndex, ]
bikeTest <- bikeData[-trainIndex, ]
```

Mean rentals(count) and total rentals are produced for each factor ("season", "weather" & "hour") to complement the box plots generated for each factor.

```{r, quantstats}

quantStats <- sumBikeTrain %>% select(c(4, 5, 6, 9)) %>% apply(2, summary)

# create correlations for numeric vars
rentalCor <- select(sumBikeTrain, c(temp, humidity, windspeed, rentals))
# correlations as data frame
rentalCor <- as.data.frame(round(cor(rentalCor), digits = 2))

# Modeling

Based on the summary analysis the "workday" variable and "windspeed" variables are removed for regression tree and boosted tree modeling. There were few observations for days off (only holidays) for weekdays and saturday and sunday are all days off.  So the assessment for each day absorbs the "workday" variable.  Windspeed had small correlation to "rentals" (cnt) and this was depicted in the point plots with near zero regression slopes per category.  The final variables for R-Tree and Boosted Tree analysis are: "hour" (seems strong per summary data and box plots), "temp" (also strong summary data with highest positive correlation to rentals - born out in regression line by category), "humidity" (relatively strong correlation to rentals and distinct lines by category in point plots) "season", and "weather".

## Tree Based Model (non-ensemble)

A Regression Tree model is used for the initial prediction.  An iterative approach using "Leave One Out Cross Validation" is employed to determine the best variables and complexity parameter for lowest RMSE for a given computational time (unscientifically measured) were used to determine the final model.  All predictors are initially trained with variable importance plot produced.  The top 3 and bottom 3 (non-zero) most/least important factors were compared to the "all fit".  "Top 3 Fit" predictors had the  the RMSE for the optimal computer generated CP as the "All Fit".  Adding additional predictors did not lower RMSE.  Removing predictors increased RMSE. "Top 3 Fit" was chosen for tuning based on a vector of CP's.  The highest CP that did not significantly lower RMSE was chosen as the best Final Model.  Prediction using the final model was run against the test data set with final results output

## Boosted Tree Model

An ensemble Boosted Tree model is used for the second prediction.  All variables are considered for the training fits using a 50 fold cross validation control. Folds of 10, 100, 170 were also used and 50 provided the best intersection of lower RMSE at reasonable computational cost(time).  An initial training fit with system generated controls for shrinkage, n-trees, and interaction depth was run. A tuning grid was created to see if these controls could be improved and a 2nd fit was trained.  The 2nd fit did not improve over the computer generated "best model" so that model was used as the final model for prediction on the test data set.

### Initial Boosted Fit

```{r, boosted}

# Train program defined tuning controls
boostedFit <- train(rentals ~ ., data = bikeTrain1,
                   method = "gbm", preProcess =
                   c("center", "scale"), trControl = 
                   trainControl(method = "cv", 
                   number = 50), verbose = FALSE)

# output the results                
kable(round(boostedFit$results, digits = 2))
```

### Tuned Boosted Fit


```{r, boosted tuned}

# grid of tuning parameters
gbm_grid <- expand.grid(n.trees = c(200, 250),
                        interaction.depth = (4),
                        shrinkage = c(.1, .2), 
                        n.minobsinnode = 10)

# train user defined tuning controls using grid
boostedFitX <- train(rentals ~ ., data = bikeTrain1,
                   method = "gbm", preProcess =
                   c("center", "scale"), trControl = 
                   trainControl(method = "cv", 
                   number = 50), verbose = FALSE,
                   tuneGrid = expand.grid(gbm_grid))

# output results
kable(round(boostedFitX$results, digits = 2))
```
### Final Boosted Model

```{r, boosted final}
# grid of final model parameters
gbm_grid1 <- expand.grid(n.trees = 150,
                        interaction.depth = 3,
                        shrinkage = .1, 
                        n.minobsinnode = 10)

# train final model
boostedFinal <- train(rentals ~ ., data = bikeTrain1,
                   method = "gbm", preProcess =
                   c("center", "scale"), trControl = 
                   trainControl(method = "cv", 
                   number = 50), verbose = FALSE,
                   tuneGrid = expand.grid(gbm_grid1))

# output results
boostedFinal$finalModel
```
### Prediction

```{r, boosted prediction}
# predict using final model on test data
boostedPred <- predict(boostedFinal, newdata = bikeTest1)

# create tibble of prediction results
boostedPred_results <- as_tibble(postResample(boostedPred, bikeTest1$rentals))

# round results
boostedPred_results$value <- round(boostedPred_results$value, digits = 2)

# rename rows for output
setattr(boostedPred_results, "row.names", c("RMSE", "Rsquared", "MAE"))

# output prediction results
kable(boostedPred_results, caption = "Boosted Tree Prediction Results")
                  
```

## Prediction Discussion

Both models produced similar RMSE results with the Boosted Tree model slightly outperforming the Regression Tree model. Advantages of Regression Tree model - fewer trees/less complex.  Disadvantage of Regression Tree - more computational intensive using LOOC and multiple model variations had to be run to determine the best fit.  Advantages of Boosted Tree model - less computational expensive and produced a better result for a relatively "light" fold count.  Disadvantage - more coding to set up tuning grid options and final model is more complex than the R-Tree.
