Introduction
============

The data for the bicycle rental analysis and prediction consists of
hourly rental information each day for a two year period (2011 & 2012)
totaling &gt; 17k observations. The goal of the project is to predict
number of rentals for each day based on a set of predictors.

The data is split into 70% training & 30% test sets. The training set is
used for an initial summary analysis to determine optimal predictors and
suitable predictive models. Categorical variables are converted from
numbers to factors for the summary analysis and renamed for more
relevant interpretation. Those were:

-   season (“winter”, “spring”, “summer”, "fall)

-   hour (divided into: “late night”, “AM commute”, “mid day”, “PM
    commute”, “night”)

-   weather (“clear”, “mist”, “light precip”, “heavy pricip”)

-   workday (“no”, “yes”)

-   dteday

Numerical predictors considered in the summary analysis are: temp,
humidity and windspeed

Categorical summaries include a table for rental mean and rental total
for each factor and boxplots for each factor.

Numeric summaries include a 5 number summary, pairwise correlation table
and scatter plots + lm faceted by season, hour & weather for each
numeric variable.

Based on analysis of these variables final training / test sets were
developed on season, hour, weather, temp, and humidity. These sets were
used to conduct Regression Tree and Boosted Regression tree training and
prediction models. More info about predictor considerations and final
model criteria with test results are discussed in the “Modeling”
section.

Summary Analysis

Categorical Data

Mean rentals(count) and total rentals are produced for each factor
(“season”, “weather” & “hour”) to complement the box plots generated for
each factor.

    sum_meanFx <- function(cat, ...) {

Qunatitative Summaries

### Numeric Data & Plots

Five number summaries + mean and a correlation matrix are produced for
“temp”, “humidity”, “windspeed” and “rentals” (count). Point plots with
regression lines are produced for each categorical variable (“season”,
“weather”, “hour” and “workday”)

    quantStats <- sumBikeTrain %>% select(c(4, 5, 6, 9)) %>% apply(2, summary)

    # create correlations for numeric vars
    rentalCor <- select(sumBikeTrain, c(temp, humidity, windspeed, rentals))
    # correlations as data frame
    rentalCor <- as.data.frame(round(cor(rentalCor), digits = 2))

    # output 5 number summary + mean and pw correlations

Modeling
========

Based on the summary analysis the “workday” variable and “windspeed”
variables are removed for regression tree and boosted tree modeling.
There were few observations for days off (only holidays) for weekdays
and saturday and sunday are all days off. So the assessment for each day
absorbs the “workday” variable. Windspeed had small correlation to
“rentals” (cnt) and this was depicted in the point plots with near zero
regression slopes per category. The final variables for R-Tree and
Boosted Tree analysis are: “hour” (seems strong per summary data and box
plots), “temp” (also strong summary data with highest positive
correlation to rentals - born out in regression line by category),
“humidity” (relatively strong correlation to rentals and distinct lines
by category in point plots) “season”, and “weather”.

Tree Based Model (non-ensemble)
-------------------------------

A Regression Tree model is used for the initial prediction. An iterative
approach using “Leave One Out Cross Validation” is employed to determine
the best variables and complexity parameter for lowest RMSE for a given
computational time (unscientifically measured) were used to determine
the final model. All predictors are initially trained with variable
importance plot produced. The top 3 and bottom 3 (non-zero) most/least
important factors were compared to the “all fit”. “Top 3 Fit” predictors
had the the RMSE for the optimal computer generated CP as the “All Fit”.
Adding additional predictors did not lower RMSE. Removing predictors
increased RMSE. “Top 3 Fit” was chosen for tuning based on a vector of
CP’s. The highest CP that did not significantly lower RMSE was chosen as
the best Final Model. Prediction using the final model was run against
the test data set with final results output

Regression Tree Prediction Results

Boosted Tree Model
------------------

An ensemble Boosted Tree model is used for the second prediction. All
variables are considered for the training fits using a 50 fold cross
validation control. Folds of 10, 100, 170 were also used and 50 provided
the best intersection of lower RMSE at reasonable computational
cost(time). An initial training fit with system generated controls for
shrinkage, n-trees, and interaction depth was run. A tuning grid was
created to see if these controls could be improved and a 2nd fit was
trained. The 2nd fit did not improve over the computer generated “best
model” so that model was used as the final model for prediction on the
test data set.

Boosted Tree Prediction Results

Prediction Discussion
---------------------

Both models produced similar RMSE results with the Boosted Tree model
slightly outperforming the Regression Tree model. Advantages of
Regression Tree model - fewer trees/less complex. Disadvantage of
Regression Tree - more computational intensive using LOOC and multiple
model variations had to be run to determine the best fit. Advantages of
Boosted Tree model - less computational expensive and produced a better
result for a relatively “light” fold count. Disadvantage - more coding
to set up tuning grid options and final model is more complex than the
R-Tree.
